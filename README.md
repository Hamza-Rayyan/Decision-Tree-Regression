# Decision-Tree-Regression

Truth or Bluff model testing on Decision Tree regression model
Truth or Bluff using SVR model. The dataset and prediction aim is same as previous model https://github.com/Hamza-Rayyan/Polynomial_linear_regression

#Observation
  -The decision tree algorithm basically keep splitting the data for fetching more insights of data it splits and categouries the data is a less than or greater than.
  -whenever a arbitary point is searchered from a plane it show in which split or leave it is present.
  -Every leaf arverage is taken to find the which data-point belong to which leaf, every new datapoint will be named the average values of the groups or split it is in.
